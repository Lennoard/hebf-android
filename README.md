Originally created by [Ivsom  Emidio](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5968361/), HEBF Optimizer is an Android application that aims to improve how your device performs and focuses on battery saving by adjusting Android system and/or kernel parameters using superuser privileges.

The application also features a useful and intelligent toolbox that you can use whenever you want.

```
❗ **Disclaimer**
This application can and will modify system and kernel parameters in order to achieve desired results. 
I am not responsible for any side effects (if any) or damages (if any) caused by this application.

## Features
### 🔋 VIP Battery Saver
VIP Battery Saver puts your device into a deep battery saving mode by setting the CPU governor along with several other parameters  of your choice such as force-stopping apps ("hibernating"), forcing the device into idle state (doze) and disabling checked features (WiFi, bluetooth, etc.). VIP  can be  used with [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) to be  triggered in certain events or scheduled within the app itself. It is a very useful option if want to keep your device alive as longer as possible.

### 🎮 Game Booster
In contrast to VIP Battery Saver, this Game Booster ramps up the CPU to get better instant performance. It can also trigger the DnD mode and force-stop apps as well to avoid interruptions while gaming.
  
### ⛏ This is also a root toolbox
HEBF provides a nice interface for power users to tweak their device. There are some advanced stuff like the Window Manager, ART Compiler Filter and well-known stuff like a CPU and RAM Manager, Fstrim and a Cleaner section. There are also several general battery, performance internet tweaks you can apply, all within a single app.

## Requirements
-   Android 4.1+
-   Root access (although the app has a rootless version,  **it will be dropped out soon**)
